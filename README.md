# Knight-game
This is a programming exercise to implement a simple game, see rules.txt for more details about the rules of the game. The program will print the end state of the board once all moves have been processed.
This game requires Python 3.

To run the game: 
python3 knight_game.py

It will read moves from the file moves.txt in the same directory.

To run the unit tests:
python3 test_game.py

The unit tests will use both moves.txt and moves2.txt as test input data.
